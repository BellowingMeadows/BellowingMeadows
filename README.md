# Little Paradise - Band Website

## Code Institute's Milestone Project 1 - User Centric Front-End

Little Paradise are a musical duo who write and record songs from a home studio in Bristol. Having spent the best part of a year on creating new music, the band (of which I am one of the two members) has decided to build an online presence now that musical content is ready to be released to the world. My aim with this project is to design and create a band website which can act as a convenient and memorable hub of music and informative content for users to consume. As owners of the site, the band’s goals are to promote their music, convince users to sign-up to email updates, and encourage engagement with the band’s fledgling brand via a biography page and a photo gallery. Users of the website on the other hand will likely be arriving to learn more about a band that they have recently discovered elsewhere online, including when they might be playing live in the future.
 
This project is the first of four ‘milestone’ projects which are required to complete the Code Institute’s diploma in full stack web development. Assessment criteria for this milestone project centres on the ability to produce a static, front-end site using HTML and CSS learned during the first part of the course.

## UX

My goals for the creation of this website are as follows:

* Provide an area online that centralises all the most important and relevant information about Mike & Fran’s music project for interested users.
* Encourage engagement with the band’s music and brand.
* Encourage new users to sign-up for email updates.
* Design the website to be aesthetically pleasing and based on newly learnt principles of UX design, accessibility and responsivity to various screen sizes.

The following user stories will be at the forefront of my thinking as I progress through the development process:
 
Band member

* As a member of Little Paradise, I would like to start building an online presence that will engage new and existing fans of my music. While the various existing social media platforms that already exist will play an important part in cultivating our online presence, I have found that they are too generic to concisely lay out all of the information I deem relevant to music fans. I therefore need a custom website that can be used to promote my music and consolidate information that potential new fans will find useful and informative. This website also has the potential to convince new users to sign-up to email updates so that I can send notifications about new releases and shows more directly.

New users

* I have been recommended the band by a friend and found a link to the website on google or through one of the band’s social media pages. I would like to listen to their music and find out a bit more general information about the band to decide whether this is a band I would like to keep tabs on.

* I have seen the band live, and this was my first exposure to their music. I google the band to see if they have a website as I would like to hear what music they have recorded.

* I am a booking agent for small music venues around Bristol. Having heard the band’s music, I would like to contact the band about potential opportunities for live shows in the future. I would like to find out how I can contact the band directly to discuss these shows so go to the website in search of contact information.

Existing users

*  
I am an existing fan of Little Paradise’s music and have been on their website already as part of the band discovery process. I would like to return intermittently to the website to see if there are any upcoming tour dates available.
